# Planet - Understanding the Amazon from Space

This [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space) aims to help Planet and its Brazilian partner SCCON are challenging Kagglers to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.

Our planet looses 48 football fields worth of forests every minute, and most of that loss is in the Amazon Basin where the earth suffers reduced biodiversity, habitat loss and contribution to climate change. With better data and insight about locations of deforestation and human encroachment, we can help governments and stakeholders to respond with greater efficacy.

This notebook explores satellite imagery data collected by Planet who's goal it is to develop algorithms to understand how and why deforestation happens all over the world and ultimately, how to respond.
The goal here is to train a model that can tag Amazon Rain Forest images using seventeen possible labels concerning atmospheric conditions and different classes of land cover and land use.
